# This is the separator that is used when a set of fields has to be considered as a single String.
# This is relevant when hashing a set of fields (for example, in a GROUP operation) for uniqueness purposes, such
# as when inserting into a Sketch. Without this, for example, if you were considering two fields together as a
# group, with values ab and cd, simply concatenating them would produce abcd. This is ambiguous if you with another
# record that had values a and bcd for those two fields. Using this separator distinguishes them for this purpose.

# The maximum number of records that will be collected in the Filter Bolt till it is emitted - i.e. a micro-batch.

# the number of records your query is looking for but individually each Filter Bolt does not find enough records to
# satisfy the query. Since the records are emitted immediately, the Join (combining) stage will terminate your query as
# soon as the total records are received instead of waiting for the micro-batch size to be reached.

# The maximum number of entries used as an internal map size by a FrequentItems Sketch created for doing TOP K. It must

# the Sketch and NOT the number of unique items. There is a table that can be found at:
# https://datasketches.github.io/docs/FrequentItems/FrequentItemsErrorTable.html
