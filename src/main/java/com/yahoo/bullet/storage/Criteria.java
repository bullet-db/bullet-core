 * Encapsulates the idea of criteria that can apply themselves to a {@link StorageManager} query. This can be
 * anything like the WHERE clause of a SQL query for relational storages or something that modifies the storage or
 * whatever else. It provides the {@link #get(StorageManager)} method to retrieve the data from the storage as a
 * key-value mapping to the raw data stored. The {@link Criteria} can also wrap its results in its own format when
 * using the {@link #retrieve(StorageManager)} interface to return objects of an expected type.
 * <p>
 * A specific {@link Criteria} is intended to be implemented along with the particular {@link StorageManager} so that
 * non-public interfaces can be shared between them.
 * <p>
 * In order to allow arbitrary changes or queries to the storage, the {@link #apply(StorageManager, Object)} method is
 * also provided. This method is intended to be used for anything dealing with the storage, including retrieval. The
 * specific arguments for the query are left to the specific criteria.
