/**
 * This class implements a simple rate checking mechanism. It accepts a maximum and a time window in which the maximum
 * should not be exceeded. Call {@link #increment()} (or {@link #add(int) if batching }for when what this is counting
 * happens and then call {@link #isRateLimited()} to check if the rate limit has been reached.
 *
 * You should check if the rate is limited at least once per your given time interval. If you check too late, your
 * counted measure will be <strong>averaged</strong> over the time duration since the last check, which may or may not
 * cause your rate limit criteria to be violated. This can happen if your increments or adds are bursty so you exceed
 * the rate limit within your time interval but you neglect to check it for a long enough time interval where the burst
 * is spread out over bringing the overall rate lower than your configured maximum and yielding a false negative.
